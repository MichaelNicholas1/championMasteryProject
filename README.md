"Hello! This is a personal project that I worked on back in my senior year, December of 2019 briefly between projects as a proof-of-concept. I now (December 2020) have decided to more thoroughly expand the project in hopes of learning and adding something valuable to my portfolio. Please feel free to reference/get inspired by my code for any similar projects you wish to work on."
